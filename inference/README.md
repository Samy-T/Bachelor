# Inference

For inference should be added the pretrained model of neural network that will be used.

- Create a directory named 'inputs'. Here should be added the videos that will be used for inference.
- Create a directory named 'outputs'. After inference, here will be generated a new video in which each action detected will be written at the top-left corner of video.
